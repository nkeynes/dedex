1. Properly undo the code layout optimizations that dx performs - dedex
currently 'fixes' a couple of specific cases that break the JVM verifier,
but really we should do a full relayout back to the 'original' layout
(which would make Jode much happier as well)

2. Automate tests

3. Add some simple optimizations to generate better bytecode.
